This was originally developed for the purpose of being able to
extract xdvdfs iso images under linux. This source will compile
under win32 if  _WIN32 is defined at compile time. However due
to the requirements of using the win32 api file management funtions
for files larger then 2GB the windows version will fail on images
larger then 2GB and i have no plans on rewriting it for this purpose.

Well im not going to explain how to compile under win but the makefile
is in the lcc dir as well as the binary and obj files for the win
port. It was built with lcc-win32, a free compiler/linker/ide for win.
The project file is included as well but locations would require being
changed.

There is most likely several bugs, and it has lacked a great deal
of testing. The src is sloppy and has several known problems that need
to be fixed. Feedback is welcome at xbiso@linuxmail.org
